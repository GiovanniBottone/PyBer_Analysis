# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview 
The purpose of this analysis was to create a line graph that shows the week to week fare progression for each city from January 2019 to May 2019 for the ride-sharing app 'PyBer.' This chart focused on PyBers main focal points: rural, suburban, and urban cities. After separating the data by city type, the next step was to analyzed the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride, and average fare per driver for each city type. A chart summarizing the data can be seen below.

## Results

As seen in the chart, Urban cities dominate in total rides, total drivers, and total fare, while simultaneously having the lowest average fare per ride and average fare per driver. Between the three city types, there are 2,375 total rides, 2,973 total drivers, and $63,538.64 total fares. Urban cities have the largest percentage of these three categories, with 68.4% of total rides, 80.8% of total drivers, and 62.7% of total fares. Suburban city's have the second most among these categories, with 26.3% of total rides, 16.5% of total drivers, and 30.5% of total fares. Rural city's have the smallest percentage among htese categories, with 5.2% of totl rides, 2.6% of total drivers, and 6.8% of total fares.

Interestingly, the standings are flipped for average fare per ride and average fare per driver, with Rural having the highest fares, suburban having the second highest fares, and urban having the lowest fares. Logically, it would make sense that rural city's have higher fares due to larger travel distances. For example, suburban and urban communities often have stores and shopping centers which are easily accessible to the community, while rural city's are often more spaced out which creates larger travel distances and larger fares. The data matches this presumption, Rural city's average fare per ride is 11.7% higher than suburban and 41.1% higher than urban average fare per ride.

Below you can find the Total Fare by City Type chart illustrating the different fares from January to May 2019

As you can see from the chart, Urban city's had the highest total fares for every week, Suburban city's had the second highest total fares every week, and rural city's had the lowest total fares every week from January to May. One 'outlier' week would be the end of March / beginning of April period where Urban and Suburban city's had a drastic drop in total fares, while Rural city's total fares stayed consistent, a more in depth stud would likely be necessary to determine the reasoning.

## Summary
Based on the results of this analysis, my three recommendations for the PyBer CEO would be:
1. Add more drivers for Rural and Suburban city's 
2. Gather client demographics for more in-depth analysis
3. Set more specific time periods for future analysis.

My first recommendation, to add drivers to Rural and Suburban city's is based off the data table shown in the results section, showing that Rural city's had 47 more rides than drivers, and Suburban city's had 135 more rides than drivers. Having mpre drivers in these city types would decrease consumer wait time and increase the user experience, a potential solution for this issue would be to reallocate some of the Urban drivers, who had 780 more drivers than total rides. By moving some of the Urban drivers to the Rural and Suburban city's, the drivers have a better chance of getting a customer and the customers have a shorter wait time.

My second recomendation, to gather client demographics for a more in-depth analysis, is as simple as it sounds. By understanding who your users are - their gender, age, ethnicity, race, population size for their area, average income level for their area, etc. PyBer can have a much better understanding of who their 'true' customers are vs who their occasional customers are.

My third recommednation, to set specific time periods for future analysis also has the goal of creating a more in-depth understanding of PyBer's consumers. For example, setting a period for analysis by season, around holidays or common vacation period (college spring/fall break), PyBer would have a better understanding of their 'busy' season. Once PyBer understands their 'busy' season, they'll have a better understanding of when to expect higher or lower consumer demand, and can increase or decrease the amount of drivers they have for that period, helping their bottom lines without sacrificing anything around the consumer experince.
